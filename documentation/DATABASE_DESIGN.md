# Database Design & Justification

## Design Rationale (250 words)

The database for the MoMo SMS data processing system is designed to efficiently handle mobile money transaction records while ensuring data integrity, scalability, and query performance. The core entities identified are Users, Transactions, Transaction_Categories, Transaction_Participants, and System_Logs. Users store sender and receiver information with unique constraints on phone numbers to prevent duplication. Transactions maintain financial records linked to Users and Transaction_Categories to classify the type of transaction and enforce proper referential integrity through foreign keys. The Transaction_Participants junction table addresses many-to-many relationships, enabling tracking of multiple participants per transaction and their respective roles. System_Logs provide a robust audit trail for operations and error tracking. Data types and constraints are carefully selected to ensure correctness: DECIMAL for monetary values, ENUM for status, and DATETIME for timestamps. Indexes on primary and foreign keys optimize query performance, while check constraints enforce data validity. The design balances normalization for data consistency with practical denormalization for efficient reporting. The architecture supports future expansion, such as additional transaction types or integration with other payment platforms, and aligns with best practices for relational database design in financial applications.
